# ULD LSP VSCode

## How to use this

1. Download the files from a release of the [server](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-lsp-server/releases) and unpack them in the server directory of this extension
2. If the name of the server is different, update it in `client/src/extension.ts` by updating the [`serverPath`](https://github.com/AblingerOscar/uld-lsp-vscode/blob/7e5275512c6e43eca64bf3bf630b83b5e7c8a384/client/src/extension.ts#L22) variable accordingly
3. If you opened the extension folder in vscode, you should be able to simply run the `Launch Client` run configuration (Press Ctrl+Shift+D to switch to the Run Tab)
4. The first time you start it, the server will fail to start â€“ this is because it does not yet know which definition file to use
   1. In the settings of the launched visual studio code instance (Ctrl+,) search for `uld-lsp-vscode: Language Definition Files` and press `Edit in settings.json`
   2. Fill out the `languageId`, `languageScheme`, `languagePattern` and `definitionFilePath` properties correctly. If you want to use the examples, it should look like this:
   ```json
    "uld-lsp-vscode.languageDefinitionFiles": [
        {
            "languageId": "cocol-2",
            "languageScheme": "file",
            "languagePattern": "**/*.atg",
            "definitionFilePath": "c:\\Users\\Oscar\\Projects\\master-thesis\\uld-lsp-vscode\\examples\\Cocol-2.def"
        }
    ],
   ```
